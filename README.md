# DS210-FINAL-PROJECT
My final project for DS210! :)

In this project, I have worked with a directed citation graph and have done the following analyses:

- Implemented BFS to find the distance between each node/paper.
- Calculated the average number of citations across each paper.

I've made commits throughout this repository as I've worked through the project. Many commits are incomplete and serve as progress checks.
